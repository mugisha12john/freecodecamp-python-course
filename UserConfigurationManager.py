# Build a User Configuration Manager
# In this lab, you will build a User Configuration Manager that allows users to manage their settings such as theme, language, and notifications. You will implement functions to add, update, delete, and view user settings.
#
# Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
#
# User Stories:
#
# You should define a function named add_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair
#
# add_setting function should:
#
# Convert the key and value to lowercase.
# If the key setting exists, return Setting '[key]' already exists! Cannot add a new setting with this name.
# If the key setting doesn't exist, add the key-value pair to the given dictionary of settings and return Setting '[key]' added with value '[value]' successfully!.
# The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.
# You should define a function named update_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a tuple containing a key-value pair.
#
# update_setting function should:
#
# Convert the key and value to lowercase.
# If the key setting exists, update its value in the given dictionary of settings and return: Setting '[key]' updated to '[value]' successfully!
# If the key setting doesn't exist, return Setting '[key]' does not exist! Cannot update a non-existing setting.
# The messages returned should have the key and value in lowercase.
# You should define a function named delete_setting with two parameters representing a dictionary of settings and a key.
#
# delete_setting function should:
#
# Convert the key passed to lowercase.
# If the key setting exists, remove the key-value pair from the given dictionary of settings and return Setting '[key]' deleted successfully!
# If the key setting does not exist, return Setting not found!
# The messages returned should have the key in lowercase.
# You should define a function named view_settings with one parameter representing a dictionary of settings.
#
# view_settings function should:
#
# Return No settings available. if the given dictionary of settings is empty.
# If the dictionary contains any settings, return a string displaying the settings. The string should start with Current User Settings: followed by the key-value pairs,
# each on a new line and with the key capitalized. For example,
# view_settings({'theme': 'dark', 'notifications': 'enabled', 'volume': 'high'}) should return:
# Current User Settings:
# Theme: dark
# Notifications: enabled
# Volume: high
#
# For testing the code, you should create a dictionary named test_settings to store some user configuration preferences.


# def add_setting(dictionary):
#     new_dict = {}
#     for key in dictionary:
#         new_dict.update({key.lower(): dictionary[key].lower()})
#     return new_dict
# print(add_setting({'yes': 'True', 'No': 'False'}))
